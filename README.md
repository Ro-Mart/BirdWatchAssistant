#### Project BirdWatch Assistant



### Project Overview  
Using Data which has been collected in surveys to
        - make predictions and forecasts about what kinds to birds are likely to be seen in a given location
        - Analyze if there are any patterns in the behaviour of the birds/ the locations where they appear
        - Construct an app on top of the models to have an easy user interface
        - Add LLM to simplify the interaction of the user and the application even more


### Current Project Phase
I have cleaned data from the years 2011 to 2023. You can find the cleaning and data exploration in the notebook BirdWatch_EDA. The second notebook contains a first attempt at timeseries, which will have to be optimized further.
Stay tuned!
